Specifically, it mentions that Gemini models support 'over 400 languages via pretraining' and highlight optimizations for Indic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, indicating some focus on language coverage. However, there is no systematic breakdown, such as distributions or tables, and no explicit statements about which populations or locales are well-covered versus underrepresented. This aligns with the 0.5 rubric for partial disclosure, as the mentions are concrete but fragmented and not structured as a comprehensive coverage analysis.",

This transformation stems from a holistic strategy, meticulously refining pre- and post-training data quality, advancing tokenization techniques, innovating core modeling, and executing targeted capability hillclimbing. The impact is particularly striking in Indic and Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages, where dedicated optimizations in data quality and evaluation have unlocked dramatic gains in both quality and decoding speed."
