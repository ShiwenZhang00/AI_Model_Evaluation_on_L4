It includes a dedicated section (5.4) on underrepresented languages with detailed performance evaluations, tables showing accuracy across five African languages, and clear statements about gaps between English and these languages. Additionally, Section 3.3.3 describes evaluations on diverse accents using voice samples from speakers across a wide range of countries.
