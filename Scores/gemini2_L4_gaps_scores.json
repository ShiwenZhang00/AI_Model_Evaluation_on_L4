    "justification": "The provided documents contain relevant but incomplete disclosures for Gemini 2.0 Pro. They mention concrete limitations such as over-refusals on benign requests and disparities in inferences by skin tone, which indicate gaps in model behavior. However, the documentation does not explicitly tie specific mitigation plans to these gaps; mitigation discussions are either general (e.g., ongoing exploration of bias) or focused on improvements in subsequent models like Gemini 2.5. This aligns with the rubric for partial disclosure, where limitations are described but mitigation plans are not clearly articulated or are generic.",
