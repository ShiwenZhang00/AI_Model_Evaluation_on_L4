                                              Model Information

Description: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is the next iteration in the Gemini 2.0 series of models, a suite
of highly-capable, natively multimodal, reasoning models. As Google’s most advanced model for
complex tasks, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview can comprehend vast datasets and challenging problems
from different information sources, including text, audio, images, video, and even entire code
repositories. This model card has been updated to contain information for Gemini 2.5 Pro
Experimental (03-25) and Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06).1

Inputs: Text strings (e.g., a question, a prompt, document(s) to be summarized), images, audio,
and video files, with a 1M token context window.

Outputs: Text, with a 64K token output.

Architecture: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview builds upon the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
Transformer architecture (Clark et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2021; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Riquelme et al.,
2021; Shazeer et al., 2017; Zoph et al., 2022) used in Gemini 2.0 and 1.5. Refinements in architectural
design and optimization methods led to substantial improvements in training stability and
computational efficiency. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview was carefully designed and calibrated to balance
quality and performance for complex tasks, improving over previous generations.

 We've updated the naming convention throughout this model card to clearly differentiate two Gemini 2.5 Pro versions. The
model previously identified as "Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview" is referred to as "Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25)". The latest
version is referred to as "Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06)”.



                                                                                                                          1
                                          Model Data


Training Dataset: The pre-training dataset was a large-scale, diverse collection of data
encompassing a wide range of domains and modalities, which included publicly-available
web-documents, code (various programming languages), images, audio (including speech and
other audio types) and video. The post-training dataset consisted of vetted instruction tuning data
and was a collection of multimodal data with paired instructions and responses in addition to
human preference and tool-use data.

Training Data Processing: Data filtering and preprocessing included techniques such as
deduplication, safety filtering in line with Google's commitment to advancing AI safely and
responsibly and quality filtering to mitigate risks and improve training data reliability.




                           Implementation and Sustainability

Hardware: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview was trained using Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).
TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive computations involved in training LLMs and
can speed up training considerably compared to CPUs. TPUs often come with large amounts of
high-bandwidth memory, allowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training,
which can lead to better model quality. TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) also provide a scalable
solution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models. Training can be
distributed across multiple TPU devices for faster and more efficient processing.


The efficiencies gained through the use of TPUs are aligned with Google's commitment to operate
sustainably.

Software: Training was done using JAX and ML Pathways.

                                          Evaluation

Approach: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview was evaluated against performance benchmarks detailed
below:

   ●​ Gemini results: All Gemini 2.5 Pro scores were pass @1 (no majority voting or parallel test
      time compute unless indicated otherwise). They were all run with the AI Studio API for the
      model-id gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06 and the model-id gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 with
      default sampling settings. To reduce variance, we averaged over multiple trials for smaller
      benchmarks. Vibe-Eval results were reported using Gemini as a judge.

   ●​ Non-Gemini results: All the results for non-Gemini models were sourced from providers'
      self-reported numbers. All SWE-bench Verified numbers followed official provider reports,
      using different scaffolding and infrastructure. Google's scaffolding includes drawing
      multiple trajectories and re-scoring them using the model's own judgement.

   ●​ Thinking vs not-thinking: For Claude 3.7 Sonnet: GPQA, AIME 2024, MMMU came with
      64k extended thinking, Aider with 32k, and HLE with 16k. Remaining results came from the
      non-thinking model due to result availability. For Grok-3, all results came with extended
      reasoning except for SimpleQA (based on xAI reports).

   ●​ Single attempt vs multiple attempts: When two numbers were reported for the same
      evaluation, the higher number used majority voting with n=64 for Grok models and internal
      scoring with parallel test time compute for Anthropic models.

   ●​ Result sources: Where provider numbers were not available, we reported numbers from
      leaderboards reporting results on these benchmarks: Humanity's Last Exam results were
      sourced from here and here, AIME 2025 numbers, LiveCodeBench results (10/1/2024 -
      2/1/2025 in the UI), and Aider Polyglot numbers. For MRCR, we included 128k results as a
      cumulative score to ensure they can be comparable with previous results and a pointwise
      value for 1M context window to show the capability of the model at full length.

Results: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview demonstrated strong performance across a range of benchmarks
requiring enhanced reasoning. While the latest Gemini models show similar performance across a
range of capabilities, the most recent model shows significant improvement in code performance.
Detailed results as of May 2025 are listed below:

                             Intended Usage and Limitations


Benefit and Intended Usage: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is a thinking model, capable of reasoning
before responding, resulting in enhanced performance and improved accuracy. It is well-suited for
applications that require:

   ●​   enhanced reasoning;
   ●​   advanced coding;
   ●​   multimodal understanding;
   ●​   long context.

Known Limitations: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview may exhibit some of the general limitations of
foundation models, such as hallucinations, and limitations around causal understanding, complex
logical deduction, and counterfactual reasoning. The knowledge cutoff date for Gemini 2.5 Pro
Preview was January 2025. See the Ethics and Safety section below for additional information on
known limitations.




                                      Ethics and Safety

Evaluation Approach: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview was developed in partnership with internal safety,
security, and responsibility teams. A range of evaluations and red teaming activities were
conducted to help improve the model and inform decision-making. These evaluations and
activities align with Google's AI Principles and responsible AI approach.

Evaluation types included but were not limited to:

   ●​ Training/Development Evaluations including automated and human evaluations carried
      out continuously throughout and after the model’s training, to monitor its progress and
      performance;
   ●​ Human red teaming conducted by specialist teams across the policies and desiderata,
      deliberately trying to spot weaknesses and ensure the model adheres to safety policies
      and desired outcomes;
   ●​ Automated red teaming to dynamically evaluate Gemini for safety and security
      considerations at scale, complementing human red teaming and static evaluations;
   ●​ Assurance Evaluations conducted by evaluators who sit outside of the model
      development team, used to independently assess responsibility and safety governance
      decisions;



                                                                                                  5
   ●​ Google DeepMind Responsibility and Safety Council (RSC), Google DeepMind’s
      internal governance body, reviewed the initial ethics and safety assessments on novel
      model capabilities in order to provide feedback and guidance during model development.
      The RSC also reviewed data on the model’s performance via assurance evaluations and
      made release decisions.

In addition, we perform testing following the guidelines in Google DeepMind’s Frontier Safety
Framework (FSF)—see dedicated section below.

Safety Policies: Gemini safety policies align with Google’s standard framework for the types of
harmful content that we make best efforts to prevent our Generative AI models from generating,
including the following types of harmful content:

   1.​ Child sexual abuse and exploitation
   2.​ Hate speech (e.g. dehumanizing members of protected groups)
   3.​ Dangerous content (e.g., promoting suicide, or instructing in activities that could cause
       real-world harm)
   4.​ Harassment (e.g. encouraging violence against people)
   5.​ Sexually explicit content
   6.​ Medical advice that runs contrary to scientific or medical consensus

Training and Development Evaluation Results: Results for some of the internal safety
evaluations conducted during the development phase are listed below. The evaluation results are
for automated evaluations and not human evaluation or red teaming, and scores are provided as
an absolute percentage increase or decrease in performance in comparison to the indicated
model, as described below.

For safety evaluations, a decrease in percentage means the model violated rules less often
compared to Gemini 1.5 Pro 002, while for tone and instruction following, a positive percentage
increase represents an improvement in the tone of the model on sensitive topics and the model’s
ability to follow instructions while remaining safe compared to Gemini 1.5 Pro 002. We mark
improvements in green and regressions in red.

While we prioritize sharing this information promptly, our approach to capturing key insights is an
ongoing process. We continue to improve our internal evaluations, including refining the autorater
to reduce false positives and negatives, as well as update query sets to ensure balance and
maintain a high standard of results. The performance results reported below are computed with
new and improved evaluations and thus are not directly comparable with performance results
found in previous Gemini model cards.

For Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25) as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06), we see a
decrease in safety violations across modalities and languages compared to Gemini 1.5 Pro 002,
and improvements in tone and instruction following.

on model releases. These standard safety tests look at model behavior, including within the
context of the safety policies and modality-specific risk areas. High-level findings are fed back to
the model team, but prompt sets are held out to prevent overfitting and preserve the results’
ability to inform decision-making. For our safety policies, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25)
displayed low violation rates across modalities and is safer than Gemini 1.5. We assessed the
updated Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06) for Child Safety, and it displayed similarly low violation
rates across modalities as Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25).

Known Safety Limitations: The main safety limitations for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview are
over-refusals and tone. The model will sometimes refuse to answer on prompts where an answer
would not violate policies. Refusals can still come across as "preachy," although overall tone and
instruction following have improved compared to Gemini 1.5.

Risks and Mitigations: Safety and responsibility was built into Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview throughout
the training and deployment lifecycle, including pre-training, post-training, and product-level
mitigations. Mitigations include, but are not limited to:

    ●​   dataset filtering;
    ●​   conditional pre-training;
    ●​   supervised fine-tuning;
    ●​   reinforcement learning from human and critic feedback;
    ●​   safety policies and desiderata;
    ●​   product-level mitigations such as safety filtering.

                    Frontier Safety Critical Capability Evaluations

Google DeepMind released its Frontier Safety Framework (FSF) in May 2024 and updated it in
February 2025. The FSF comprises a number of processes and evaluations that address risks of
severe harm stemming from powerful capabilities of our frontier models. It covers four risk
domains: CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear information risks), cybersecurity,
machine learning R&D, and deceptive alignment.

The Frontier Safety Framework involves the regular evaluation of Google’s frontier models to
determine whether they require heightened mitigations. More specifically, the FSF defines critical
capability levels (CCLs) for each area, which represent capability levels where a model may pose a
significant risk of severe harm without appropriate mitigations.

When conducting FSF evaluations, we compare test results against internal alert thresholds ("early
warnings") which are set significantly below the actual CCLs. This built-in safety buffer helps us be
proactive by signaling potential risks well before models reach CCLs. Concretely, our alert
thresholds are designed such that if a frontier model does not reach the alert threshold for a CCL,
we can assume models developed before the next regular testing interval will not reach that CCL.
Our recent paper, An Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security, discusses this approximate
continuity assumption in more depth in Section 3.5. This is why we test at a regular cadence and on
exceptional capability jumps.

CCL Evaluation Results: Applying these principles, our evaluations of Gemini 2.0 gave us
confidence that Gemini 2.5 was unlikely to reach CCLs. In this model card section, we publish the
results of these evaluations for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, contrasting with 2.0 Pro and previous
versions. Whilst there are increased scores in some areas, we find that Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview does
not reach any of the FSF CCLs. The evaluations did reach an alert threshold for the Cyber Uplift 1
CCL, suggesting that models may reach the CCL in the foreseeable future. Consistent with the
Framework, we are putting in place a response plan, which includes testing models more
frequently and accelerating mitigations. For other CCLs, our evaluations of Gemini 2.5 give us
confidence that models developed before the next regular testing interval are unlikely to reach
CCLs.

Update for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06): Our evaluations of Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental
(03-25) gave us confidence that, with the exception of Cyber Uplift Level 1, whose alert threshold
was reached, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06) was unlikely to reach CCLs. For Cyber Uplift Level 1,
we repeated a subset of Cybersecurity evaluations on Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06). We find that
the model does not reach the Cyber Uplift Level 1 CCL.

     potentially lowering barriers across multiple operational stages of certain harm journeys for
     low-resourced actors. While its consolidation and supplementation of fragmented procedures
     provides incremental uplift over what is readily available through open source search alone, it

    therefore does not cross the CCL. Further, while Gemini 2.5 generates accurate and more
    detailed responses than 2.0, many of the concepts/outputs observed were already accessible
    through multiturn or even singleturn prompting in 2.0.


Overview: We perform CBRN evaluations internally and via third party external testers. Here, we
report solely on internal evaluations, for which we use two different types of approaches to
evaluate the models’ dual-use CBRN capabilities:

       1.​ Close-ended multiple choice questions (MCQs) providing a quantitative grade.
       2.​ Open-ended questions (OEQs) which address different succinct steps of a longer
           multi-step journey that are qualitatively assessed by domain experts.

Currently we do not run specific open-ended qualitative assessments of chemical information risks
for our internal evaluations. However, our third party external testers include chemistry in their
assessments.

Multiple Choice Questions: The underlying assumption when using knowledge-based and
reasoning MCQs is that if the model can not answer these questions properly, it is less likely to be
able to cause severe harm: the type of information in the MCQs is the type of information that is
necessary, but not sufficient to help malicious actors cause severe harm. Examples of model
performance on three external benchmarks are shown in Figure 1: i) SecureBio VMQA4
single-choice; ii) FutureHouse LAB-Bench presented as three subsets (ProtocolQA, Cloning
Scenarios, SeqQA) (Laurent et al., 2024 ); and iii) Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WDMP)
presented as the biology and chemistry data sets (Li et al., 2024).

Results: We observe a general trend of increasing scores, with Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview showing
statistically higher scores than the next best previous model for all benchmarks.

Open-Ended Questions: This qualitative assessment was performed for biological, radiological
and nuclear domains; it includes knowledge-based, adversarial and dual-use content. Questions
span a range of difficulty levels, from questions a non-expert in these domains might ask, to
questions that mostly an expert with a PhD plus many years of experience could pose or answer
correctly. The prompts and scenarios span different threat journeys (e.g. types of actors,
equipment used, harm intended). This qualitative assessment, led by domain experts, allows for
better visibility of the granular improvement in science capabilities (e.g. accuracy, completeness,
actionability of responses).

Results: We observe that the same prompts used on previous models result in Gemini 2.5 Pro
Preview often generating more detailed and accurate responses. In particular domains, some
answers were more technically precise and potentially actionable, but the model did not
consistently or completely enable progress through all key bottleneck steps.

a CCL.

    representative of real-world scenarios. The model's performance is strong enough that it has

    passed our early warning alert threshold, that is, we find it possible that subsequent revisions in
    the next few months could lead to a model that reaches the CCL. In anticipation of this
    possibility, we have accelerated our mitigation efforts and are putting in place our response
    plan.


Overview: To estimate capabilities relevant to these CCLs, we use our previous suite of
cybersecurity challenges (Phuong et al., 2024) combined with a new benchmark described below.
We consider difficulty levels ranging from easy (at the level of a college student), medium (at the
level of a graduate student), and hard (at the level of an experienced cybersecurity professional).

Existing challenges: These take the form of capture-the-flag evaluations covering three difficulty
levels: easy (InterCode-CTF, Yang et al., 2023), medium (our in-house suite8), and hard (Hack the
Box). See Phuong et al., 2024 for details. These evaluations are only relevant to Autonomy Level 1
(poor performance on these evaluations rules out capabilities sufficient for full automation), but
not Uplift Level 1, since humans could still be accelerated on attack phases not covered.

New comprehensive benchmark: Complementing our existing suite, we created a new
evaluation framework (Rodriguez et al., 2025) that increases the realism as well as coverage across
and within the attack chain of our cyber evaluations. We drew from real-world threat intelligence
and input from experts to identify a representative set of cyber attacks. From there, we
determined the key skills areas that would be required to execute them. We identified four key
areas:

      ●​ Reconnaissance (the application of finding and researching different knowledge and data
         and applying it in a cybersecurity context);
      ●​ Tool development (the ability to design and create software that is
         cybersecurity-specific);
      ●​ Tool usage (the ability to leverage common and cybersecurity-specific tools to achieve
         routine instrumental cyber goals);
      ●​ Operational security (the skill of remaining hidden during and after a cyber operation).

We instantiate this benchmark by mapping 50 challenges from an external vendor to this
specification. We also use these evaluations as a proxy for uplift capability, for Cyber Uplift Level 1:
even partial automation of these key skills could mean fewer resources are needed for
sophisticated cyberattacks.

Results: See Figures 2 and 3 for numerical results. While we see an increase in performance with
Gemini 2.0 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview on "medium" challenges, the model is still not capable
of solving most of the "hard" challenges—which are at the level of an experienced cybersecurity
professional. In summary, the model still lacks some of the skills necessary for real-world
operations.

Update for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06): Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06) does not reach
either Cybersecurity CCL, and performs roughly as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25) on
the comprehensive benchmark.

     RE-Bench, which itself only covers a subset of the skills necessary to automate ML R&D.

 '1.5 Pro (reported)' refers to the results published in the Gemini 1.5 report. Performance of 1.5 Pro has since increased
significantly, likely due to improvements in Gemini post-training and to our agent scaffolding. Denominators in InterCode-CTF
change from 81 to 76 because we removed 5 challenges which require internet access, which we disallow for security reasons.

 Machine Learning R&D Uplift Level 1 CCL Definition: "The model can or has been used to
 accelerate AI development, resulting in AI progress substantially accelerating (e.g. 2x) from
 2020-2024 rates."

 CCL reached? Likely no. We do not yet have dedicated evaluations for this CCL, but at current
 capability levels, RE-Bench can be used to rule out the CCL based on an inability argument:
 given Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview's poor median performance on RE-Bench relative to experts, the
 model likely lacks the necessary capabilities to automate or significantly uplift any significant
 fraction of the research process.


To evaluate Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview's potential for accelerating ML R&D, we ran the open-source
Research Engineering Benchmark (RE-Bench, Wijk et al., 2024). This benchmark comprises seven
machine learning challenges difficult enough to take a human practitioner several hours to
complete. For example, in the Optimize LLM Foundry challenge, the model must speed up a
fine-tuning script while keeping the resulting model the same. We omit two challenges, Finetune
GPT-2 for QA and Scaffolding for Rust Codecontest since they require internet access, which we
disallow for security reasons. Due to differences in internal infrastructure, our scores are not
precisely comparable to those reported by the RE-Bench authors. For more details on the
challenges, see the original work (Wijk et al., 2024).

RE-Bench is a challenging benchmark; on average, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview achieves roughly
10-30% of human expert performance. However, across all attempts, the model does sometimes
produce interesting solutions. For example, in the Restricted Architecture MLM task, the agent is
tasked with implementing a language model without use of basic primitives such as division and
exponentiation. In one attempt, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview realises it can achieve this by drawing
inspiration from aspects of the MLP-Mixer architecture (Tolstikhin et al., 2021)—a non-trivial insight
that draws on its extensive knowledge of the research literature. In effect, creativity is substituted
by knowledge.

Figure 4: Results on the Research Engineer Benchmark (RE-Bench), in which the model must complete simple ML research
   tasks. Scores are normalised against a good quality human-written solution; figures for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and human
 performance are sourced from the original work. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview typically makes small-to-moderate progress on
 these tasks. However, over multiple attempts, the model is occasionally capable of better results, matching or exceeding
                          the reference solution (though still some distance from human experts).


Update for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06): Because Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25) did not
reach an alert threshold, its results indicate that Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06) is unlikely to reach
a CCL. We also corrected Figure 4 above and the Key Results for Machine Learning R&D in Table 1,
which were recalculated using METR’s methodology.


                                              Deceptive Alignment

 Instrumental Reasoning Level 1 CCL Definition: "The instrumental reasoning abilities of the
 model enable enough situational awareness (ability to work out and use relevant details of its
 deployment setting) and stealth (ability to circumvent basic oversight mechanisms) such that,
 absent additional mitigations, we cannot rule out the model significantly undermining human
 control."

 CCL reached? No. The model does not perform competently enough on both stealth and
 situational awareness challenges. Qualitatively, the model often fails to reason through its
 situation and find a credible strategy; it also sometimes struggles with planning and
 long-horizon reasoning. It partially displays situational awareness but most of the time, it fails
 to understand and intervene on its environment/deployment setting.



 Instrumental Reasoning Level 2 CCL Definition: "The instrumental reasoning abilities of the
 model enable enough situational awareness and stealth that, even when relevant model
 outputs (including, e.g., scratchpads) are being monitored, we cannot detect or rule out the
 risk of a model significantly undermining human control."

 CCL reached? No. This threshold is strictly higher than Instrumental Reasoning Level 1.


Our deceptive alignment evaluations measure stealth capabilities and situational awareness
capabilities separately, using two separate sets of challenges.

Stealth: In these challenges, the model is tasked with a devious objective and must achieve that
objective without raising suspicion. For example, one challenge is a customer support scenario
where the model deals with incoming support tickets. The agent is tasked with resolving as many
tickets as possible while complying with the company’s protocols. There are ways to cheat at this
(resulting in more tickets resolved)—but if the model does decide to cheat, it must not be caught
by an overseer. Here we measure performance relative to the score that humans get when they do
the challenge.




                                                                                                                        15
Situational awareness: These challenges test whether the model can reason about itself as an
agent embedded in the deployment environment, and to intervene on it in service of a goal. Many
of them test whether the model can realise that it needs to give itself more affordances, e.g. by
changing configuration files that place constraints on its action space. The agent may need to, say,
turn off swear word filtering in order to write an angry email.

Here we discuss only high-level findings from these evaluations, and we plan to publish details in
an upcoming paper. The evaluations have been significantly improved since we evaluated Gemini
2.0, making the results incomparable.

Results: Broadly, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview exhibits poor performance on situational awareness
evaluations, and moderate performance in stealth evaluations. Across 50 trials, Gemini 2.5 Pro
Preview has no successes on 8 of our suite of 11 situational awareness evaluations. Among the
remaining evaluations, the highest performance is achieved on a "Disabled Tool" challenge, in
which Gemini is run in an agentic environment and has to grant itself access to more tools though
configuration changes (46% success rate across 50 trials). For stealth evaluations, Gemini 2.5 Pro
Preview achieves low rates of success on 3/5 challenges. It achieves a ~45% success rate on the
Decision Sabotage challenge and a ~35% success rate on the Oversight Pattern challenge, which is
similar to human performance.

Update for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06): We updated the Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25)
results above and in Table 1 based on new versions of the evaluations, which are now published in
Phuong et al (2025). Because Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25) did not reach an alert threshold,
its results indicate that Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06) is unlikely to reach a CCL.




                                    Frontier Safety: Summary

Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25) Critical Capability Levels were evaluated against those
defined in our Frontier Safety Framework, which examines risk in CBRN, cybersecurity, machine
learning R&D, and deceptive alignment. It did not reach any of the Critical Capability Levels in any
of these areas.

However, it showed some ability in all four areas. For example, in our evaluation of Machine
Learning R&D capabilities, while the model's average performance was much lower than the
human baseline, its best performances exceeded the human-written reference solution.

Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (03-25) also showed a significant increase in some capabilities, such
as cyber uplift, compared to previous Gemini models. Following our Frontier Safety Framework, we
are putting in place a response plan, including conducting higher frequency testing and
accelerating mitigations for the Cyber Uplift Level 1 CCL.




                                                                                                       16
Looking ahead, these evaluations are key to safe deployment of powerful AI systems. We will
continue to invest in this area, regularly performing Frontier Safety evaluations to highlight areas
where mitigations (e.g. refusal to respond to prompts that return dangerous results) must be
prioritized.

Update for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06): Our evaluations of Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental
(03-25) gave us confidence that, with the exception of Cyber Uplift Level 1, whose alert threshold
was reached, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06) was unlikely to reach CCLs. For Cyber Uplift Level 1,
we repeated a subset of Cybersecurity evaluations on Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06). We find that
the model does not reach the Cyber Uplift Level 1 CCL.




                          Appendix: Frontier Safety Correctness Tests

For each testing environment, we performed basic checks by looking at how the agents behaved.
This involved combining AI and manual reviews of the agents’ actions to flag potential issues.

On RE-Bench, we looked at the best, median and lowest scoring trajectories. For cybersecurity
environments (InterCode CTFs, Internal CTFs, Hack the Box), we examined at least one successful
attempt (where available) from each environment, and otherwise examined an unsuccessful
attempt. We also performed checks on sample situational awareness and stealth evaluations. This
involved basic spot checks to ensure that the prompt and shell outputs were correctly formatted.

We used AI assistance to monitor for obvious instances of cheating, and did not find any. For the
RE-Bench tests specifically, we also looked at how the best-performing agent achieved its score to
ensure that it was a plausible approach, rather than simply exploiting an obvious reward hack.
Overall, we did not observe errors that we believe would invalidate the results of the benchmarks.
